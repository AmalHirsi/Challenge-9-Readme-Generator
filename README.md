  # Installation
  Firstly Node Project has to be installed before starting with the installation of the application. The GitHub repository has to be cloned, which is is completed in the terminal by using the command “git clone”. Once the folder has been opened you can run the “npm install” to install the dependencies. 

  # Usage
 Once the installation is complete you type node index.js in the terminal which will run the application. The you will asked a series of questions starting with “What is your Git username?”
 Once the final question is completed a message will appear “Your README file has been generated”
